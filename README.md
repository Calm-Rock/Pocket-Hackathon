# Pocket-Hackathon
This is a submission for [Pocket Network DAO Global Bounty](https://gitcoin.co/issue/pokt-foundation/bounties/3/100026898) on Gitcoin.

You can see the live demo [here]()

A short video demo is available [here]()

This dApp uses the RPC endpoint minted from the Pokt portal to find the basic details of a transaction on Ethereum Blockchain.
It's created using the streamlit python library.

Shortcomings
- If after a certain interval the transaction details are not followed then the app will throw an error. After putting the trnsaction hash detail in the search bar it works smootly. Will integrate a logic to handle this error in future.
